<h style="font-size:50px;">The Effect Of Cell Phone Use On Student Learning</h>
<p>  The effect of cell phone use on student learning is debatable. There is data that portrays positive and negative attributes. Therefore, you can’t be entirely sure whether it’s a good thing, or a bad thing. Until you bring all of the data together. So, let's get started!</p>
<p>  Kids rely on their devices for just about everything, from talking to their friends to school to entertainment. Approximately 80% of the time spent on teen devices is on social media apps and video games. Some use a small amount of time on their phones doing school work,  but most use them for an easy A+. About half the time teens are so addicted to their phones that they will do just about anything to keep it(with complaints(unless that's a requirement)).</p>
<p>  One of the main reasons that parents get their kids phones is for the ability to call them in an emergency, but that opens up the opportunity to call or text others, not just their parents. They can have a text conversation with their parents about important stuff, but they can also do that with friends in class about random stuff. They can call their parents in an emergency, but they can also call up their friend to schedule a party at their house on their parents night out. They can set alarms to remind themselves of things, but they can also make disrupting sounds in class. For every pro a parent can come up with, there is a con that kids will take advantage of.</p>
<p>  After spending enough time on social media you start to forget how to interact with real people. You think of shorthand, acronyms or slang terms before you think of real words. Normal people who don’t have phones don’t speak text, so it's hard to communicate with them. They become obsessed with streamers and want to be just like them, then when they grow up and start streaming they fall because of the low income just being a streamer. Some people are destroyed by the filters others use and wish that they looked that flawless. Life with a phone is hard because you need to adapt to two worlds instead of one.</p>
<p>  These things can be avoided by introducing phones after their brains are better developed. Introducing devices at ages like 6 or 7 can lead to lifelong drain bamage. They become more incapable of imagining life without their phone the earlier that they are introduced into their lives. People have gone to the digital world and never came back. Official conclusion, cellular devices are bad for kids 14 and under and are still a risk for people 15 and up.</p>
