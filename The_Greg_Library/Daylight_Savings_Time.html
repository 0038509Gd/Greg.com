<h style="font-size:50px;">Why Daylight Saving Time Is Stupid</h>
<p>  Hey yaul! Welcome back to another essay. Today it’s all about this stupidity that's called “daylight saving time”. Anyways, let's get started on today's content.</p>
<p>  Almost everyone hates daylight saving time, I do, my mom does, my dad does, do you? If you have an analog clock you have to reset it twice a year, every year. If you call your buddy in a country without daylight savings time and you do, good luck scheduling anything. This is just the dumbest thing.</p>
<p>  Everybody's got analog watches and clocks. Aren’t you annoyed that every year you have to set it an hour ahead just to have to reset it an hour back? The only solution to this is the overly expensive digital clocks. Which my grandma doesn't trust so she got an analog one. If the government thinks that we will just get all digital clocks then they can shove a raccoon up their rectal sphincter.</p>
<p>  Who here dislikes(understatement of the millenia) daylight saving time. It makes us go to bed early. If not, it makes us get up early. And from the scientific side it screws with our internal clocks. I say “BOO” to the POINTLESSNESS of daylight saving time!</p>
<p>  Daylight saving time is like a virus. if one country has it and they interact with another one, the other one will likely adopt the concept. If you have it and the other person doesn't then it is an absolute pain for either person to schedule squat. I feel bad for accountants. I think that we can all agree that daylight saving time is dumb.</p>
<p>  This is why we need to bug the government about daylight saving time. Anyway, see you next essay, and text your state representative, allright?</p><br>
