<h style="font-size:50px;">Rouge-Bot</h>
<p>  Life in the lab was boring, lonely and tireing so I made an assistant. It would be a simple machine with a self destruct button programmed into it that ran off of battery, it would drive around and run entirely off of codes. When I first pressed the on button it imploded, second time 
it exploded, third time it worked!</p>
<p>  Two years later it was like a son to me, and I made the biggest mistake ever, giving it AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). That's where things got out of hand, it learned to think for itself, it stopped following my codes and instructions.Then it even threw me -his creator-  out of my own lab.</p>
<p>  The next time I saw him he was tearing through the US military air force, army and navy with his own army of robots! I was traumatized and furious, then I realized, my lab is empty! So I ran all the way home and collected my nitrogliserin and sulfuric acid tipped arrows to launch at the 200 foot tall rouge-bot. Then I went to grab my ion cannon, but then I remembered that I didn't have one. When I went to grab my shield generator it wasn't there, then I realized my rogue-bot had them due to the hole on the other side of the vault.</p>
<p>  While I was searching my lab for useful stuff, I found: A Machine Nerf Gun, Some Wires, Batteries, 2 Motors and some circuits. I fit them together and made the ion cannon that I was looking for earlier but remembered I didn't have one. It wouldn't work on the rogue-bot but it would work on the other bots. It having the shields ment no ion cannon and no laser blasters. Only solid ammunition.</p>
<p>  The arrows weren't working very well but they did a little bit (They mostly just bounced off). The ion cannon only fired once. The rogue-bot took a while to find me and when it did, I turned to run for it. I tripped and accidentally pressed a few buttons on my watch and then, boom. It exploded, I had completely forgotten about the self-destruct button I had programmed into the original design at the very beginning.</p>
<p>  “Ever since this happened I never made another device without a self-destruct activation of some kind or with AGI. It was hard to attack the robot I once thought of as my son. It hurt, a lot. But it had to be done. Ok, now kids, LEAVE ME ALONE, and GET OUT.”<br>“Kids these days, always asking about my robots and how holographic homework works so that they can destroy it. Uuuugh, it's exhausting. That's why I never had kids.”</p><br>
