<h style="font-size:50px;">Pink Ping Pong Ball(2)<br>Dinky</h>
<p>  Once upon a time there was a happy couple, 39 year old Bob and Bobina. They had been married for 6 years and then they had quintuplets: Bob.jr, Bobert, Boberten, Bobington and Dinky. Dinky was always somehow 6 feet wide at all times. Ever since birth he was an interesting child, he would only drink Ludacris Lime Lemonade. His brothers made fun of him for this, all 4 of them, and that's how the Whole House Water War I, Whole House Water War II and Whole House Water War III started. (Don’t Ask For Details)</p>
<p>  The Whole House Water War’s were on Dinky’s first and second birthdays. For his third birthday he asked for carbonated Ludacris Lime Lemonade, which started Whole House Water War III. That one got bloody because of a deadly incident with a toothpick. DO NOT ASK FOR DETAILS.</p>
<p>  Bob and Bobina were very nervous about sending Dinky to school for obvious reasons. But he did not cause a district wide war involving water or toothpicks, this was a relief to the parents. His brothers on the other hand were disappointed.</p>
<p>  Since Dinky was 6 feet wide Bobina hired a carpenter to make all the door frames 7 feet wide, so that was interesting. Bobjr was not a big fan of this. There was a Whole House Water War IIII, except this time Dinky had no part in it.</p>
<p>  When Dinky graduated 6th grade, he had a graduation party. Bobington drank EVERYTHING, Bobjr ate EVERYTHING, Bobert buried ALL of the guests and Boberten spent the entire time eating DIRT. Dinky was panicking in the hole Bobert buried him in the entire time. When his parents got back mom screamed so loud that the entire neighborhood needed window repairs. Then dad spent 2 hours digging the kids up. Then he grounded Bob.jr, Bobert, Boberten and Bobington for the mess. And got Dinky some carbonated Ludacris Lime Lemonade.</p>
<p>  Dinky had always loved the thick green, yellow bubbly drink. So every single celebration of him he asked for Ludacris Lime Lemonade, christmas, his birthday or anything else.</p>
<p>  When he got a girlfriend named Barny she would get him Ludacris Lime Lemonade. When he got married they faced each other with a Ludacris Lime Lemonade flavored cake. And when he was 42 they had identical Sextuplets (Bill, Binky, Phenq, Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II, Sludgy the IIII IIII II and Sookini) he received Ludacris Lime Lemonade. They were a handful.</p>
<p>  And finally he lay on his deathbed 44 years old. His 4 brothers, wife and 6 kids all standing around him they finally asked “why do you like Ludacris Lime Lemonade so much tell us why” he responded “I will tell you why” every one leaned in close “the reason I like Ludacris Lime Lemonade so much is because…” And he dies from lack of oxygen.</p><br>
