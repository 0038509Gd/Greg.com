<h style="font-size:50px;">Pink Ping Pong Ball(1)<br>Bob</h>
<p>  Once upon a time there was a family who had a baby. They named him Bob. Bob was a weird baby. He just would not stop chewing in his toy ball. He would spend all day gnawing on the rubber sphere. The only way moma and papa could get Bob to eat was if they put pink baby food on his ball. Then he would chew the slop of of his sloberry rubber toy.</p>
<p>  Two years later Bob said his first phrase “Ping Pig Pon Ba”. Mom and dad thought it was so cute that they got him a Pink Ping Pong Ball. Bob loved it so much that he would pet it, sleep with it and take it everywhere with Bob. When he took it to Day care no one but Bob played with it or even cared about it.</p>
<p>  On Bob's third birthday his parents asked him what he wanted and he said “I Wanna Ping Ping Pong Bau!” Mom and dad looked at each other and then said “Allright, but you can't take them to school any more. Ok?” On his first day of school he didn’t take it, he snuck it in and got his Pink Ping Pong Ball taken away. Mom and dad were really mad, but caved in to the puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>  On Bob's fifth birthday mom asked him what he wanted for Christmas and he said “Can I please have a Pink Ping Pong Ball. But can I please take it to school just once?" Mom said no and got him the Pink Ping Pong Ball. On his tenth birthday mom asked him what he wanted for his birthday and he said “Can I please have a Pink Ping Pong Ball. I promise not to take it to school." Mom said OK and got him the Pink Ping Pong Ball.</p>
<p>  When Bob graduated from grade school his papa asked him where he wanted to go and he said “I would like to get an English Pink Ping Pong Ball?” Dad said Ok to the new gift. When he graduated from middle school he asked for a German Pink Ping Pong Ball. When he graduated  from high school he asked for an Australian Pink Ping Pong Ball. When he got a college invitation he asked for a pink box for ping pong balls. After 4 years of college Bob graduated. For his college graduation gift he wanted an Egyptian Pink Ping Pong Ball.</p>
<p>  After graduating Bob got a job in the army at the age of 20. During a fight he got his arm severely hurt. It needed to be removed up to the elbow. In the military hospital they asked if they could get him anything, he said “Could you get me a Pink Ping Pong Ball?” They didn't have any Pink Ping Pong Balls but they had decent sized bullets and pink paint. After 5 years of service with one arm, he was finally released. The first thing he did was go to the hospital to get a prosthetic arm. It didn’t cost that much to get a custom Pink Ping Pong Ball pressure cannon arm ($20k) but it was very useful!</p>
<p>  5 years later Bob met someone, her name was Bobina. They dated for 3 years and had an extra special one annually, on the day they met. And every time he asked for a Pink Ping Pong Ball. Eventually they had a wedding in Italy. When they went to get each other wedding gifts he asked for an Italian Pink Ping Pong Ball. And Bob got Bobina a Pink Ping Pong Ball from Paris, a strawberry-spheer-cake for the wedding and a wedding ring with a miniature Pink Ping Pong Ball. It took her a while to figure out what it was, but in the end she did. On their honeymoon they went to a cabin in the middle of New York city that had a Pink Ping Pong Ball pit.</p>
<p>  On Bob's first anniversary he asked for a Mexican Pink Ping Pong Ball. He got Bobina a genuine pink star diamond ring. On his second anniversary he asked for an Arabian Pink Ping Pong Ball. He took her to a very fancy restaurant. On his third anniversary he asked for a Nigerian Pink Ping Pong Ball. He got her a genuine Egyptian Pink Ping Pong Ball. On his fourth anniversary he asked for a portuguese Pink Ping Pong Ball. He got her an at home movie theater. On his fifth anniversary he asked for a 1863 Russian Pink Ping Pong Ball. He got her a pet dog.</p>
<p>  After 6 years of being married 39 year old Bob and Bobina had identical quintuplets, Bob.jr, Bobert, Boberten, Bobington and Dinky. None of them had any interest at all in chewing or sucking on toy balls. This puzzled Bob because he thought it was genetic but apparently not. But they did have an interest in kissing sea monkeys. And Dinky was always somehow 6 feet wide at all times.</p>
<p>  On Bob's first fathers day Bob.jr, Bobert, Boberten, Bobington and Dinky were only 5 they picked out a Pink Ping Pong Ball clock for him. He was so happy to receive his first Pink Ping Pong Ball related thing from his kids. On his second fathers day they were 6 and they picked out a Pink Ping Pong Ball Rolex watch, but mom bought a Pink Ping Pong Ball vtech watch instead. On his third fathers day Bob had gotten into fishing, so his 7 year old kids got him a Pink Ping Pong Ball themed fishing kit, it even had a Pink Ping Pong Ball Bobber! On his fourth fathers day the kids were 8 and they got him his very own Pink Ping Pong Ball pedestal for his very first Pink Ping Pong Ball. Bob appreciated this very much. On his fifth fathers day Bob had been talking about how exquisite the Pink Ping Pong Balls from the Bahamas were. His kids overheard it and got him one. On his tenth fathers day Bob's kids were officially 14 and they went out and got him the one and only original smallest Pink Ping Pong Ball. It was so small he had to put it in a box with a microscope. On his twentieth fathers day Bob's kids were officially 24 and they got him the one and only Original 1542 Dented Pink Ping Pong Ball. Bob was so happy he gave them $100 each for the magnificent gift.</p>
<p>  On Bob's 80th birthday he retired and had a retirement party. At the party he had strawberry donut holes and a ping pong table he won every round. Finally his kids and wife finally asked him “Why Pink? Why Ping Pong Balls? Tell us why you alway ask for Pink Ping Pong Balls for every gift you receive. Tell us. Why?” Bob replied “I will tell you when I am ready. For now let's celebrate the end of my career” and so the party went on until the time scheduled to end the party came.</p>
<p>  15 years after retiring he was on his deathbed. There was a terrible car accident, and he would die from the injuries. His loved ones, close friends and coworkers surrounded him in his last moments. They asked him once again “Why do you love Pink Ping Pong Balls so much? Please tell us.” Bob replied “ OK I will tell you why Pink Ping Pong Balls make me so happy” Everyone leaned in close to hear what he was about to say. “The reason I love Pink Ping Pong Balls so much is because…” and he dies from los of oxygen.</p><br>
