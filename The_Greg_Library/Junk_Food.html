<p>  Believe it or not, restaurants have taken advantage of the fact that people don’t look at the ingredients. Guess what, back in the day Taco Bell used grade D meat, the lowest grade of food legal to feed to humans. Also, most restaurants use GMO or genetically modified organisms to make their food taste better. And yes, consuming GMOs can modify your DNA as well. In summary, check the ingredients.</p>
<p>  Welcome to the wonderful world of diabetes. There are 3 ways to get diabetes, have your pancreas surgically removed, be allergic to your own insulin, or have your cells develop a resistance to said insulin.

<p>  How to avoid becoming a fat mutated humanoid. Buy your own food. Eat a balanced diet. And check ingredients of pre-made food. Please follow at least these tips so i don’t have to deal with humanoids.</p>
