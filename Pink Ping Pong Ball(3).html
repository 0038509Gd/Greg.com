<p>  When Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II was 2 years old her dad Dinky died. It was a sad experience. Her and her brothers (Bill, Binky, Phenq, Sludgy the IIII IIII II and Sookini) did not care because they had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>  Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II always loved Perplexing Purple Pancakes. They were just so purple and confusing and stale. All three things made it more of all three things. Mom would always talk about how much she and her dad had in common and that her dad liked Ludicrous Lime Lemonade which sounded absolutely disgusting, mom agreed.</p>
<p>  Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II and mom always got in huge fights about whether or not pancakes from a vending machine had any flavor or nutrition. Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II always out-logicked her mom who had a PhD in logic.</p>
<p>  The day that Phenqs pet skink Fink escaped on his birthday was its last day. Phenq went to check on Fink but couldn't find him then he thought Fink escaped so he screamed so loud that once again the entire nabor-hood needed window repairs, the cage shattered and Fink escaped on Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the IIs 17th birthday. Mom spent the entire night reassuring that Fink was happy in the backyard eating the mosquitos and eventually they got 1h of sleep. The next day the garbage disposal was clogged. They hired a plumber, the plumber had a brown mustache and wore suspenders, a red hat and a name tag that red mario. Mario found Fink. (No additional details)</p>
<p>  When Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II turned 20 she got a job at Zebra Licks. Their logo is a rubber ducky with an 8 pack, a toto, a hard hat with a lantern and bright pink toe nail polish in an airplane while holding a chainsaw and a hair comb. It was a general store. There was even an illegal section and a black market section.</p>
<p>  When Cimmidrocken-Hadl-Hadl-Bobington the II turned 21 she had a halfway to 42 party. They had Pink Ping Pong, Ludicrous Lime Lemonade and Perplexing Purple Pancakes. There apparently was a lot of family history regarding these items.</p>
<p>  When she turned 42 she had gotten married and had 1 kid they named him Bob. he really liked rubber spheres.</p>
<p>  On her 72nd birthday party her friends and family asked her about the Perplexing Purple Pancakes she was apparently obsessed with. She deflected the question and no later than 2 seconds afterward her son and future daughter in law arrived and she was hit through the head by a misled arrow. She died. Immediately.</p><br>
