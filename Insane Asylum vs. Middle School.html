<h style="font-size:50px;">Why An Insane Asylum Is A Better Learning Environment Than Middle School</h>
<p>  Dear reader, if you are reading this I like to write about random shenanigans. Today I'm writing about how an insane asylum has a better learning environment than middle school. I think there are some good points, but you could give me some tips. Anyway, let's get started!</p>
<p>  At an asylum there is a ø violence tolerance policy. If you want to start a fight, good luck keeping it going.  Because with a no violence policy, fights are broken up faster than they are started. If you are one of those guys who likes to start fights, you and your accomplices will be punished. Less fights, less injury, less stress.</p>
<p>  At an asylum they pad the walls to keep the (not so patient)Patients from hurting themselves. Therefore the literal wall is soft enough to take a nap on. And if there is a fight then if you're thrown into a wall it won't hurt, because the wall is(very) cushioned. Or if you end up getting angy you can use it as a punching bag without hurting your knuckles. So I guess there were more pillow fights than actual fights, am I right, ha, ha…OK not very funny, I get it.</p>
<p>  Let's face it, it's not that hard to beat middle school lunches, lucky for you this could be the solution. As we all know, middle schools don't care about the survival of your taste buds or your diet, the asylum doesn't care about your taste buds eather but at least they do care about your diet. While it's not a good thing at a middle school, multiple helpings of food is one positive/negative thing that's different between an insane asylum and middle school. An insane asylum may not have the best food, it's better than school lunches.</p>
<p>  In a crazy people home, there is not much to do so life is less of a time crunch. Obviously with no school comes no homework, which is always a plus. And since they think you're bonkers, you'll never have to clean your room. Therefore with the entire day at your disposal, you can do anything(within reason) you want. So enjoy the no homework or chores of a crazy people home.</p>
<p>  Here you’ll never have to worry about your grades, because there is no school. In addition, some studies have shown that it is common for people to get depresion from their grades. Therefore, the insane asylum is designed to be a stress free environment, perfect for studying. The stress invoked by grades would disrupt that delicut environment. In conclusion, grades have driven people nuts.</p>
<p>  At the asylum they don't make you ask to go “drop the kids off at the pool”. This has many positive results for example, less moist undies. Or in other cases less gravy pants. They are also not legally allowed to lock any bathrooms unless it is being remodeled or in use(unlike middle schools apparently). If you think someone is nuts would you expect them to ask to go before the restroom?</p>
<p>  If you choose to actually attempt at living in an insane asylum, you would be giving some things up. If I had to go a day without my little brother I’d be fine, but if it's more than a week I'd go nuts(the point is “so would you”). And there is no WIFI or cell service. At least you don't have to deal with parents or siblings.</p>
<p>  Well, reader? What  did you think? Is an insane asylum a better learning environment than middle school, or not? Let me know in the comments! Anyways, C-ya!</p>
